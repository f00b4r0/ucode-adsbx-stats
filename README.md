# ucode-adsbx-stats

A lightweight ucode-based replacement for https://github.com/ADSBexchange/adsbexchange-stats

Rationale: much lower (~90% less) CPU usage.

## Dependencies

 - [ucode](https://github.com/jow-/ucode/)
 - ucode-mod-zlib **or** gzip
 - ucode-mod-curl **or** curl
 
## Usage

Simply run the script in the background as user "adsbexchange", e.g.:

```sh
sudo su adsbexchange -s /bin/sh -c 'nice -19 ./adsbx-stats.uc &'
```

## Notes

Compared to the Bash original, this script cuts a few corners:

 - Only one path is searched for JSON files (easy to improve if needed);
 - No creation of UUID file is attempted: if UUID is missing, the script will
   not start.
 - No local copy of JSON file is performed (unnecessary: VFS guarantees
   read/writes to be atomic, if the data is incomplete we simply discard it and
   retry. No need to be pedantic here as missed uploads will only affect local
   map refresh rate);
 - No DNS caching is performed (this is a job for the host or local DNS resolver);
 - Age of JSON file is not checked: if it's too old, it will be discarded by
   remote server anyway.
 - Loop interval is *approximately* 5s: ucode does not allow fine-grained
   intervals (at least not without using uloop - not available on !OpenWrt, and
   here again, it doesn't matter: this will only introduce some jitter in local
   map refresh rate);
 - Finally no data is sent when there is no aircraft records. This does not
   affect the feeder uptime stats.

All these tweaks contribute to making the tool much faster, much less CPU heavy,
light on memory usage, and thus much more suitable for underpowered systems
(e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero).
